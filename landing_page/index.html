      Hey, I am Jerry Huang and I am a computer programming student in Algonquin college. I am very interested in 
      my program. I dream to become a good programmer and help our community to be more connected,
      convenient and comfortable. I am curious of everything different or new, since it can stimulate 
      my enthusiasm to explore it and focus on it and finally become expert of it.

      Past experience as a petroleum engineer helps me to develop a good problem-solving skills. 
      Every day I have to work with a team to solve various kinds of problems that oilfield face.
      when I encountered some setbacks in my job, I will say to myself:"hey, man, it is your turn
      to beat it." and then I am full of energy. I hope to use my experience, energy and professional
      skills to learn from you, work for you and make contributions for you.
